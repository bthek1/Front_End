    "### Key Features of Fetch API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Promise-Based**: The Fetch API returns **promises**, making it easier to handle asynchronous requests with cleaner, more readable code. This eliminates the need for callbacks or event-based responses that were common with **XMLHttpRequest**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n",
    "     .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "     .then(data => console.log(data))\n",
    "     .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplified Syntax**: Fetch has a more streamlined and cleaner syntax compared to `XMLHttpRequest`. It is designed to handle the most common use cases for fetching resources from a server or submitting data to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handles Different HTTP Methods**: You can make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and other HTTP requests easily with Fetch. The method of the request can be specified using options in the second argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example for a `POST` request:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {\n",
    "     method: 'POST',\n",
    "     headers: {\n",
    "       'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n",
    "     },\n",
    "     body: JSON.stringify({\n",
    "       name: 'John Doe',\n",
    "       email: 'john@example.com'\n",
    "     }),\n",
    "   })\n",
    "   .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "   .then(data => console.log(data))\n",
    "   .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Object**: Fetch returns a **Response** object that contains several useful methods and properties:\n",
    "   - `response.ok`: Boolean indicating whether the response was successful (status code in the range 200–299).\n",
    "   - `response.status`: HTTP status code of the response.\n",
    "   - `response.text()`: Extracts the response body as a plain text string.\n",
    "   - `response.json()`: Extracts the response body as a JSON object (most commonly used for APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example of response handling:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n",
    "     .then(response => {\n",
    "       if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "         throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n",
    "       }\n",
    "       return response.json();\n",
    "     })\n",
    "     .then(data => console.log(data))\n",
    "     .catch(error => console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Supports CORS**: Fetch fully supports **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**, making it easier to work with resources from different domains as long as the server allows it by setting appropriate headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Streams**: The Fetch API supports streaming data, which allows you to start processing large responses incrementally as they are received, rather than waiting for the entire response to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Abort Controller**: Fetch supports **AbortController**, which allows you to cancel a fetch request that has already been initiated. This is useful for scenarios where you want to abort a request that’s taking too long or if the user navigates away from a page.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const controller = new AbortController();\n",
    "   const signal = controller.signal;\n",
    "\n",
    "   fetch('https://api.example.com/data', { signal })\n",
    "     .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "     .then(data => console.log(data))\n",
    "     .catch(error => console.error('Fetch aborted or failed:', error));\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Abort the fetch request after 3 seconds\n",
    "   setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 3000);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Handles Various Response Formats**: The Fetch API can handle various types of responses:\n",
    "   - **JSON**: Using `response.json()`.\n",
    "   - **Text**: Using `response.text()`.\n",
    "   - **Blob**: Useful for working with binary data like images or PDFs (`response.blob()`).\n",
    "   - **FormData**: For handling form submissions and file uploads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Fetch API:\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: It’s simpler and more intuitive compared to `XMLHttpRequest`.\n",
    "- **Readability**: The promise-based approach makes code more readable and avoids \"callback hell.\"\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Works consistently across the majority of modern browsers.\n",
    "- **Streaming support**: Can handle large files in chunks without loading them all into memory.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "- **No support for `progress` events**: Unlike `XMLHttpRequest`, Fetch doesn't allow for monitoring the progress of the upload or download process.\n",
    "- **No built-in support for timeouts**: Although you can cancel a request using `AbortController`, Fetch doesn’t have built-in timeout functionality like `XMLHttpRequest`.\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Fetch only rejects a promise for network errors. It does not reject HTTP error statuses like 404 or 500; you have to manually handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- **Fetching Data from APIs**: Fetch is widely used to retrieve data from APIs, especially RESTful services returning JSON data.\n",
    "- **Submitting Forms**: Can be used to submit form data asynchronously without reloading the page.\n",
    "- **File Downloads**: Fetch can download binary data like images and PDFs using the Blob format.\n",
    "- **Canceling Requests**: Using AbortController, you can abort long-running or unnecessary requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Full Implementation:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function fetchData() {\n",
    "  try {\n",
    "    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n",
    "    if (!response.ok) {\n",
    "      throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    const data = await response.json();\n",
    "    console.log(data);\n",
    "  } catch (error) {\n",
    "    console.error('Error:', error);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fetchData();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The Fetch API is a modern, powerful way to make network requests in JavaScript. It simplifies many common tasks such as making HTTP requests, handling responses, and error management, all while using a cleaner and more readable promise-based syntax. It is supported by most modern browsers and has become the go-to for web developers when working with APIs and web servers.\n",
